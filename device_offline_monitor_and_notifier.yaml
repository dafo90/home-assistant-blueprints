blueprint:
  name: Device offline monitor & notifier
  description: >
    Regularly checks all devices every desired number of minutes and sends a
    notification when any device remains unavailable longer than the
    inactivity threshold, and when previously offline devices return online
    after being stable for at least the configured activity threshold. Supports
    include and exclude lists with priority for included entities.
